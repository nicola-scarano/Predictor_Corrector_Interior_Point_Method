# Predictor_Corrector_Interior_Point_Method
Matlab implementation of the Predictor-Corrector Interior Point Method (constrained optimization) applied to a linear programming problem. We discuss the results obtained through various graphs and comparing, among other metrics, the number of iterations and the computation time.
